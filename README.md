Summer 2020 CSCI 261 Programming Concepts

This project was for the final project fot my programming concepts class. The assignment was open ended so I created a blackjack game in C++.
The game is a player versus computer/dealer blackjack game.
The game includes:
  1) Betting features
  2) One standard deck to draw cards
  3) file IO to read in a standard deck of cards

I was the only contributor to this project.
